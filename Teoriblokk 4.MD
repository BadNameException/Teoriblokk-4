This document is written as an assignment for the course Open Source (IS-213) at the University of Agder. The purpose of the document is to answer the question as to *Why people contribute to open source projects.*

**Abstract**  
In this document we will first outline how most open source projects are structured, and how their communities work. Then we will look at how an individual can be integrated into one of these communities. Last but not least we will look at why people would want to be integrated into such a community.

**Introduction**  
The topic of motivation is a difficult one to describe concretely. People are motivated by distinctly different rewards. While some people refuse to do a job without payment in the form of money, a different person might do the same job for the enjoyment of it, while yet another might do it just for the challenge.

Before we delve into the reasons why people are motivated to commit their time to open source projects we will first look at how most open source projects are structured. Just like in commercial closed-source projects there is a clear hierarchy within an open source project. A project usually starts out with a group of people with an idea for a project. These are known as the *"core developers"* [3]. Figure 1 describes a traditional hierarchy very well. At the core we have the starting developers, and as the project grows, so does the hierarchy by adding new roles.
